       <p>Hi My name is kelly Nwansi. I am a graduate of the University of Illinos of Chicago. I majored in Economics and finance. My hobbies inculded watching basketball games, dancing sometimes, and watching comic book movies, animated or real life. I prefer the DCAU to the MCU becuase it has a darker and more interesing tone than the MCU. I have just started wearing my hair natural, so I am currently on a natural hair journey trying to figure out what does and does not work for me.</p>
